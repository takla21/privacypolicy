# Privacy Policy for Montreal Parking Finder

**Effective Date:** May 5, 2025

Thank you for using **Montreal Parking Finder**. This Privacy Policy explains how I, as an independent developer, collect, use, and protect your information when you use the app.

---

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**Montreal Parking Finder** does **not collect or store any personal information** such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.

However, the app uses third-party services and may process limited data necessary for functionality, performance, or advertising.

---

## 2. Location Data

The app uses real-time location tracking to help you find parking near your current location. Your **actual location is not stored or transmitted** to any server.

In some cases (such as feedback), the **map coordinates currently visible on the screen** may be included to help improve the app. This is not the same as the userâ€™s physical location and is used only for development purposes.

---

## 3. Feedback

If you submit feedback through the app, it may include:
- Settings you configured in the app
- Coordinates of the area currently visible on the map

This information is sent securely to my private Trello backlog and is used solely to fix bugs or improve the app. No identifying personal information is required or collected during this process.

---

## 4. Advertising

This app uses **Google Mobile Ads** to display in-app advertisements. These ads may be **personalized** based on your device data, such as installed apps or usage patterns, as per Googleâ€™s advertising practices.

Users can choose to remove ads through the appâ€™s interface if they prefer not to see them.

You can learn more about how Google uses data for advertising here:

## 5. Third-Party Services

The app uses the following third-party packages and tools that may handle certain types of data:

- **Geolocator** â€“ For real-time location (not stored)
- **Flutter Map & LatLong2** â€“ For displaying and navigating maps
- **Dio, Retrofit** â€“ For secure API communication
- **Cached Network Image** â€“ For image caching
- **Sensors Plus** â€“ For device orientation and sensors
- **Shared Preferences** â€“ For storing settings locally on your device
- **Feedback** â€“ For sending app-related info and context
- **Google Mobile Ads** â€“ For ad delivery
- **Share Plus** â€“ For sharing content via external apps

Each of these services follows its own privacy practices, and I encourage you to review their privacy policies if you have any concerns.

---

## 6. Data Retention

No personal data is stored by the app. Any data (such as app settings or visible map coordinates) included in feedback is kept solely for app improvement and not shared externally.

---

## 7. Security

I take reasonable steps to protect your information and ensure any feedback you send is handled securely. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

---

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected here, and youâ€™re encouraged to review this policy periodically for updates.
